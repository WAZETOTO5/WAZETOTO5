## 🏊‍♂️ Swimmer | Water Enthusiast | Always Chasing the Flow

Hi there! I'm someone who finds peace, challenge, and joy in the water. Swimming isn’t just a sport to me—it's a lifestyle, a way to disconnect, refocus, and push my limits.

### 💧 What Swimming Means to Me
- 🌀 Discipline through daily practice  
- 🌊 Mindfulness in every stroke  
- 🏅 Passion for progress, whether in open water or the pool  

Outside the pool, I love exploring how technology and data can enhance performance and recovery. You might find some of my experiments, tools, or trackers here on my GitHub.
